# XOR-Logic-Gate
Using Pytorch's neural network framework to solve the XOR problem with hidden layers. The simple binary XOR gate takes two inputs (0 or 1). If the two inputs are the same, the XOR object returns 0, otherwise it returns 1. The extended XOR gate has a wider training data set to include numbers between 0 and 1.
